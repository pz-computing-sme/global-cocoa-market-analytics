\## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes the 2024-2026 cocoa price cycle, highlighting the crash from the \*\*$12,000/MT peak\*\* to the current levels around \*\*$4,000/MT\*\*. It provides a strategic parallel between international parity and the "farmgate" reality faced by producers in regions like \*\*Ibirapitanga (BA)\*\*.
